*To me, Big Data is the idea that every day, a mind-boggling amount of data is being generated by human interactions, environmental factors, and the other countless intricacies of our reality. This data pool means absolutely nothing until a Data Scientist comes along to try and study this pool and extrapolate some sort of meaning and visualization that can make sense to an audience. *
